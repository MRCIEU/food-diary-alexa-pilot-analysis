# Alexa food diary pilot analysis code


This repository accompanies the paper:

Millard, LAC, et al. “Alexa, I just ate a donut”: A pilot study collecting food and drink intake data with voice input, bioRxiv 2022.


## Environment details

I use the following language versions: R-4.1.2.


The code uses some environment variables, which needs to be set in your linux environment. I set the results directory and project data directory temporarily with:

```bash
export RES_DIR="${HOME}/2021-alexa-food/results"
export PROJECT_DATA="${HOME}/2021-alexa-food/data"
```
